						<h1>Why e-Learning</h1>

					</div> -->
					<p>The world today is rapidly progressing on the road to utilization, 
						with the ever increasing number of technical applications that are used to communicate
						 and pass on knowledge. In a traditional classroom, knowledge acquisition is limited to the
						  information the instructor has and that which they can access. However, connecting students 
						  to the outside world enhances their ability to construct new knowledge.

						E-learning is an umbrella term that is used to describe a wide variety of electronic ways
						 that enable access to education, and the process in itself. These include: virtual classrooms,
						  web-based learning, computer-based learning, digital collaboration, video and audio recordings, 
						  interactive TV and many more. Thus, e-learning is suited to flexible learning methods and distance learning.
						   E-learning can however be coupled with face to face instruction, which is called blended learning.</p>

						<h1>Elements of E-Learning</h1>
					</header>
					<!-- <div class="image fit">

					</div> -->
					<p>When creating an online course, there are a number of criterion to be met. 
						Setting a list of criterion ensures that students benefit fully from the course they signed up for.
						Some common elements of e-Learning are as follows:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>The role played by the teacher/instructor is vital. He/she is necessary to offer necessary feedback to students. 
							He/she is also sometimes responsible for keeping students’ progress or scores.</li>
						<li>A well-organized Learning Management System is necessary. 
							It should be easily navigable by both the student and the instructor.</li>
						<li>The learning material is the key feature in e-learning. 
							Usually, course material is formatted in a way that is simple and easily accessible for students.</li>
						<li>Communication is important for learning. To be able to access online coursework from the instructor, 
							students have to use one or more of the many modes of communication or delivery methods.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>There is a myriad of devices today that allow teachers and learners to share knowledge. The trainer connects to viewers or listeners interactively, using multimedia, voice communications, 
						videos (live or prerecorded), presentations, product demonstrations and text chats, mostly over the internet.</p>

							<h1>Advantages of E-Learning</h1>
						</header>
						<div class="row">
						<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
							<h3>Flexibility</h3>
							<p>E-learning is very flexible as learners can access material at any time they want. Students who reside at places that are distant to the physical classrooms or those who do not have the time to be with the instructor, have the luxury of choosing a time of their convenience, to go through school coursework.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
							<h3>Wider variety of fields to choose from</h3>
							<p>There are thousands of school course-works, online degrees and certifications being offered online, today. E-Learning does not limit students’ access to fields of study that traditional face-to-face mode of learning did. It is now possible for a student in Africa to access and complete course work that is not offered in their school, but in a school that is located in a different continent. That is the power of E-learning.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
							<h3>Cost effectiveness</h3>
							<p>E-learning alleviates the need for students and instructors to be located in a central place for learning to take place. This saves money that could be spent on travelling, accommodation and other uses that school-based learners cannot escape from. Time that would be spent commuting to class could be used for other duties too.</p>
